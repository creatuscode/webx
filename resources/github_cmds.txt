1. Install 'GitHub Pull Requests and Issues'
2. Login with your Github Account in Vs code.
3. Open folder and initailize repo, you can also do it by using terminal by command >> git init.
4. Create a new file, you can see the changes will be detected.
5. To stage all the changes (ready to commit) you can click on + button, also you can use command >> git add .
6. To commit you can click on tic button, also you can use the command >> git commit -a -m "initialized project"
-a means all staged files, -m means message, (IMPORTANT: master branch is the local repository branch!!)
Now you have to push it by using remote to github repository (remote is like a pipe line)
7. Click on options (...) go to Remote, add new remote, add link to github repo 'https://github.com/creatuscode/webx.git', give name to remote as 'origin'
8. Now push using cmd >> git push remotename branchname >> git push origin master

9. Create a new "parallel-version" branch on GitHub repo.
10. Connect to your VS code >> git checkout newbranchname >> git checkout parallel-version 
NOT WORKING? Use this cmd >> git checkout -b parallel-version instead.
